    This class is the main class of the "Escape from House" application. 
        
    To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
    method.

    This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all
    rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates and
    executes the commands that the parser returns.
